ansible playbooks to install splunk server and universal forwarder on rpm based distros.

Download the latest .rpm files from splunk and drop them in the files directory and update the vars in vars/main.yml.

Updated the command for splunk license section
 splunk start --answer-yes --no-prompt --accept-license

TODO: check if splunkforwarder already installed and running, so this will be an upgrade.
